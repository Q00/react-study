## Introduce my self

```
To me, programming is my favorite thing and exercise also as well.
Sitting still and look at the laptop screen late, I usually feel a lump in my neck, eyes, and waist.
So I love play table tennis, swim, or ride a bike. 
It makes me feel refreshed and all kinds of stress will be relieved.

In 2016, I conducted the Hashtag project, which involves biking around the country 
and interviewing people who I met. - https://maktooob.tistory.com/58?category=944210
On 21th October, entered "Triathlon with Eunchong" and completed the sprint course.

Because of my outgoing personality that I love sports and people, 
It helps me to be able to get along with people without any problems.
In working environment, the team with me was always scored well in performance review 
because of good atmosphere and communication.

Always pursuing practical things led to think about how it can help my life by coding.
Starting to study programming, I tried to create programs to solve something that was inconvenient.
Since the Internet was slow so that it was difficult to check the baseball results, 
I make a Kakao Plus friend that showed Naver baseball information by crawling, 
so I could get information such as baseball ranking and today starting pitcher.

This practical idea also led to think how to make server setting simply. 
Setting up servers before AWS was very difficult.
Setting up Web server by Spring framework was time consuming and inefficient to me, 
but since AWS came along, I have been able to easily deploy servers and it makes cost less. 
That's why I started studying AWS and got a certificate called AWS Solutions Architect Associate.
Also I contributed AWS repository in github "aws-amplify", when I used cognito in node-js api server.
I plan to study more to get "Developer associate" and "solutions architect professional" certificate.

Among the solutions that exist in Playauto, 
EMP is used by many companies as a solution linking several shopping malls for B2B companies. 
But inventory control function did not exist. The reason why inventory control has not been developed-
in the past is because it is difficult to make it in structure.
In this situation, Hanssem asked to make this function, so I decided to make it not exist in past.
Developing this function made me understand comprehensively solutions and process, database structure.

Since then, I joined Hyundai Medi Startup and as the first developer, 
I tried to make a good development culture such as establishing a development process, 
calling an English name, using Slack, and open a development seminar.
In order to get the data needed for the Boedac project, 
I developed a crawling program using Python "gevent" module. and worked with other developers as PM.
Finally we got a good dataset.
After all, I made a back-end API server by Django. 
For graduating university, now I quit startup and belong to Computer science major in University.

As an outsourced experience, I complete a C# project using RFID serial ports 
to provide inventory managers for refrigerators and client-side screens.
With this experience, I learned a lot about how to use the thread flexibly.

I am working as a nodejs web server mentor for mentees to be able to make the service they want. 
In the third semester, I worked on a project with mentees to conduct the project as a PM. 
As a PM, I had a lot of self-examination 
about what kind of developer I was and what kind of personality I was.
